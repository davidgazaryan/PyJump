# PyJump







## About The Project               ðŸ’»


PyJump is the first game I made with the python library pygame. I took into account gravity, collisions, enemy spawns
and objects joining/leaving the screen. Moreover, player animation was added making it so that your character is constantly moving,
whether he is jumping or not.

The objective of the game is to avoid the enemies on the ground(bison) as well as the ones in the air(bats). Each enemy that you avoid adds a point to your total score.
Collision with an enemy will result in the termination of the game and it will take you to another screen where you can decide to stop or keep playing.
